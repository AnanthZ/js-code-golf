# Anagrams words?

"Anagram" is a word/phrase that is formed after rearranging the letters of another word/phrase.

Your task is to write a function that takes 2 `String`s as arguments and returns a `Boolean` response indicating whether the strings are anagrams of each other. Additionally, the function should fail if either of the inputs contain any characters other than alphabets.
