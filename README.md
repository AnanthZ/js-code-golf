# JS Code Golf

The rules are simple. Write the smallest solution possible for each given problem statement.

There is an `index.html` file for each problem. Your submissions should be committed to the `/submissions` folder for the respective problem. The naming convention for your submitted file is `<email-username>.min.js`.

Raise a pull request to `main` branch with your committed file to create a submission.
