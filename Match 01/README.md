# FizzBuzz

Write a function named "fizzbuzz" which accepts 1 argument (say, n), which is expected to be a number.
From 1 to n, for each number, print an output:
1. "Fizz" if the iteration is divisible by 3.
2. "Buzz" if the iteration is divisible by 5.
3. "FizzBuzz" if the iteration is divisible by 3 and 5.
4. The iteration itself if it's indivisible by both 3 and 5.

Example:
```
n=16
```

Output:
```
